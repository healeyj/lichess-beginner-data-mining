# Mining Skill Improvement Behaviors of Lichess Players

This package of scripts takes a monthly Lichess PGN dataset as input, trims it to games of a selected time control, analyzes skill improvement patterns with a random sample of players, then produces scatterplot, bin, and Pearson regression visualizations of those patterns. All the parameters and filepaths are adjustable.
